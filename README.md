# mpWebComponents

Simple no-non-sense html components.

This is my first GitHub repository I created this for my own use. The goal is to keep these pure JS/CSS components as simple as possible without relying on other librairies.

This is now deprecated. I am working instead on more simple Web Controls: https://github.com/mpoirier101/mpWebControls
